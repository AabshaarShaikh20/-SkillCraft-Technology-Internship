# Introduction
This repository contains the code and analysis for Task 2 of my Data Science internship at SkillCraft Technology. For this task, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Titanic dataset.

#c Dataset
The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of data science. This dataset is widely used for educational purposes and provides an opportunity to explore various data analysis techniques.

# Task Description
- The main objective of this task was to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
- Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

#Observation
The data cleaning and exploratory data analysis performed on the Titanic dataset provided valuable insights into the factors influencing survival rates during the Titanic disaster. This analysis contributes to a better understanding of historical events and showcases the application of data science techniques in deriving meaningful insights from data.
